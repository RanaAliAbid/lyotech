                        <p>
                            Once we acknowledge receipt of your complaint we will review it
                            carefully, investigate the circumstances surrounding your
                            complaint and will try to resolve it without undue delay. We
                            shall make every effort to investigate your complaint and
                            provide you with the outcome of our investigation within one (1)
                            month from the date you have submitted your complaint to us.
                            During the investigation process will keep you updated on the
                            handling process of your complaint. In the event that your
                            complaint requires further investigation and we cannot resolve
                            it within one (1) month, we will notify you and indicate the
                            causes of the delay and when our investigation is likely to be
                            completed. Please note that we shall consider your complaint as
                            closed and cease the relevant investigation, in case you fail to
                            respond to our officers within the period of one (1) month from
                            the date of the submission of your complaint.

                            When we reach an outcome, we will inform you of it together with
                            an explanation of our position and any remedy measures we intend
                            to take. In the event you believe we did not solve your
                            complaint in a satisfactory way after 8 weeks, you have the
